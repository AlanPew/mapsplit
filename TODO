* We don't need seperate node, way and relation maps, recombine them
  and use 2 bits of the key for marking the type of node

* Get rid of the Java (Tree)Set implementation in HeapMap as it is 
  memory exhaustion. Write a memory optimized version.

* make it possible to easily switch to other zoom-levels (harder task)
  - at least zoomlevels < 13 should be easy, add support for those

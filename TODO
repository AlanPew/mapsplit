* Missing border treatment: Nodes, Ways and Relations near a border
  should be saved in the neighbour tiles, too.

* We don't need seperate node, way and relation maps, recombine them
  and use 2 bits of the key for marking the type of node

* Get rid of the Java (Tree)Set implementation in HeapMap as it is 
  memory exhaustion. Write a memory optimized version.

* make it possible to easily switch to other zoom-levels (harder task)

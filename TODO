* Store areas ways that go around a tile in the tile in the middle

* Missing border treatment: Nodes, Ways and Relations near a border
  should be saved in the neighbour tiles, too.

* We don't need seperate node, way and relation maps, recombine them
  and use 2 bits of the key for marking the type of node

* Get rid of the Java (Tree)Set implementation in HeapMap as it is 
  memory exhaustion. Write a memory optimized version.

* make it possible to easily switch to other zoom-levels (harder task)
  - at least zoomlevels < 13 should be easy, add support for those

* write *all* tiles for no date option (instead of the two day default)

* add a format-string option for the output dir/filename

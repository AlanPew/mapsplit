General
=======

This s a small application to split a larger map file into single
tiles. It arose by the need of a fast way to split a OSM map file
for rendering 3D tiles with OSM2World (www.osm2world.org). Only
tiles that have changes in them are stored afterwards.

Limitations
===========

The current implementation keeps everything that's needed in main 
memory. With 4GB of main memory you can parse maps with up to 100
million nodes, however, memory usage also depends on the number of
tiles that got changed.
